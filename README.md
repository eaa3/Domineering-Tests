## About the tests

The game tree generated by your submission is going to be tested against a correctly pre-generated game tree, for different board sizes up to 4x4. First all subtrees of your game tree should have the same height as the solution game tree for all corresponding tested board sizes. Second, all subtrees of your game tree should have the same number of nodes as the solution game tree all corresponding tested board sizes. Your submission is correct if all tests pass.
